## Introduction:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alice_chess

*“For some minutes Alice stood without speaking, looking out in all directions over the country – and a most curious country it was. There were a number of tiny little brooks running straight across it from side to side, and the ground between was divided up into squares by a number of little green hedges, that reached from brook to brook. ‘I declare it’s marked out just like a large chessboard!’ Alice said at last.”* ***Through the Looking-Glass (1871) - Lewis Carroll***

## Usage:
```
go build && ./go-alice-chess
